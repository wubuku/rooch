### Rooch Community Dev Meeting

- Discuss in detail which mapping scheme to use for the Rooch multi-chain address, directly use the hash to generate or follow the address similar to Ethereum (by padding zero as the prefix to reach the length of the Rooch address), the preferred Ed25519 generated address, CLI supports other encryption algorithms. See [Multi-chain Address to Rooch Address #449](https://github.com/rooch-network/rooch/issues/449) and [Address, Authentication Key Generation #540](https://github.com/rooch-network/rooch/issues/540).
- To discuss defining some strategies for handling MoveAction, we need to decode MoveAction in Move. Usage scenario: define a whitelist authentication validator, only the modules in the whitelist can be executed. The function returns MoveAction, just like a dynamic call to the function, see [#487](https://github.com/rooch-network/rooch/issues/487).
